Observable: Generic observable objects for C++
==============================================

Did you ever needed to implement the observer pattern and didn't have an easy
way to do it? This is for those times.

The library is usable on both Windows and Linux with any recent compiler that
supports at least C++14.

You don't need to compile anything, the library is header-only; so you can 
easily integrate it into your project.

If you want to build the tests and benchmarks, theyâ€™re using CMake, so that
should be easy too.
